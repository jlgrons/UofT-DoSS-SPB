\section{Course Outline}

Basics of probability theory, distribution theory of random variables, moments and inequalities, and limit theorems with examples and counterexamples.

\section{Textbooks}

The main reference for this course are the lecture notes, which will be made available on the course website as we progress through the course. The following books were used in preparing the course, and are recommended textbooks for STA2111H Graduate Probability I and STA 2211H Graduate Probability II.
